	  <h3> Timeline: </h3>
	  <ol>
		  <li>2023: I started playing volleyball in 8th grade. Ever since then, I've been playing volleyball. 
		  I have been playing as a starter on the Wasatch Junior High team. My position was a setter. 
		  We were undefeated and won the championship. In the same year I tried out for the Skyline High School volleyball team.
		  I ended up making varsity and playing as a starter.</li>
		  
	  </ol>

		  <h3>Yuji Nishida</h3>
		<li>Yuji Nishida is my G.O.A.T. because he is the player who made me want to play volleyball. I've always wanted to play like him.
		He is very short for his volleyball position, He is a opposite hitter and has to attack the ball.
		He is only 6 foot 1, but his position's average height is 6-6 foot 9. Yuji Nishida's vertical jump is 41.3 inches.</li>
